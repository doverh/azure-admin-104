# Deploy and manage Azure compute resources

## Automate deployment of resources by using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates or Bicep files

### Benefits

- You can *deploy, manage, and monitor all the resources for your solution as a group*.
Resources can be deployed to any new or existing resource group. Deployment of resources to a resource group becomes a job where you can track the template execution.
- You can repeatedly *deploy your solution throughout the development lifecycle*
- You can manage your infrastructure through *declarative templates* rather than scripts.
- You can *define the √çdependencies between resources* so they're deployed in the correct order.
- You can apply access control to all services in your resource group because *Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)* is natively integrated into the management platform.
- You can *apply tags to resources to logically organize all the resources in your subscription*.
- You can *clarify your organization's billing by viewing costs for a group of resources sharing the same tag*.
